# Fault-related terms and definitions

## Fault

abnormal condition that can cause an element \(3.41\) or an item \(3.84\) to fail

> Note 1 to entry: permanent, intermittent, and transient faults \(3.173\) \(especially soft errors\) are considered.
>
> Note 2 to entry: when a subsystem is in an error \(3.46\) state it could result in a fault for the system \(3.163\).
>
> Note 3 to entry: an intermittent fault occurs from time to time and then disappears again. This type of fault can occur when a component \(3.21\) is on the verge of breaking down or, for example, due to an internal malfunction in a switch. Some systematic faults \(3.165\) \(e.g., timing irregularities \) could lead to intermittent faults.
