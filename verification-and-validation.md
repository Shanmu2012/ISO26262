# Verification and Validation

Verification and Validation are two major components in systems engineering. The differences between verification and validation can cause confusion. This document attempts to summarize the basic objectives, similarities, and differences between verification and validation from a broader perspective.

## Definitions

### Verification

According to ISO 26262- 2018 \(E\)- Part 1 page 27, verification is to determine whether an examined object meets its specified requirements.

Verification activities may include: 

* verification review \(technical review,  walk-through, inspection\);
* verification testing;
* simulation;
* prototyping; and
* analysis \(safety analysis, control flow analysis, data flow analysis, etc.\).

> Verification review are verification activities to ensure that the result of a development activity fulfils the project or technical requirements.
>
> **The goal of verification review to ensure the technical correctness and completeness of the element or item.**
