# FMEDA

FMEDA is a method for verifying hardware architecture metrics. For electromechanical hardware parts, only the eletrical failure modes and the failure rates are considered. The estimated failure rates for hardware parts used in the analyses shall be determined by:

* using hardware part failure rates data from a recognised industry source.
* using statistic based on filed returns or tests. In this case, the estimated failure rate should have an adequate confidence level.
* using expert judgment founded on an engineering approach based on quantitative and qualitative arguments. Expert judgment shall be exercised in accordance with structured criteria as a basis for this judgment. These criteria shall be set before the estimation of failure rates is made. The criteria for expert judgment can include field experience, testing, reliability analysis, and novelty of design.
