# Fault-related terms and definitions

## Fault

abnormal condition that can cause an element \(3.41\) or an item \(3.84\) to fail

> Note 1 to entry: permanent, intermittent, and transient faults \(3.173\) \(especially soft errors\) are considered.
>
> Note 2 to entry: when a subsystem is in an error \(3.46\) state it could result in a fault for the system \(3.163\).
>
> Note 3 to entry: an intermittent fault occurs from time to time and then disappears again. This type of fault can occur when a component \(3.21\) is on the verge of breaking down or, for example, due to an internal malfunction in a switch. Some systematic faults \(3.165\) \(e.g., timing irregularities \) could lead to intermittent faults.



## Detected fault

## Dual-point fault

## 3.57 Fault injection

## 3.58 Fault model

## 3.60 Fault tolerance

## 3.85 Latent fault

## 3.97 Multiple-point fault

## 3.108 Perceived fault

## 3.109 Permanent fault

## 3.119 Random hardware fault

## 3.125 Residual fault

## 3.130 Safe fault

fault \(3.54\) whose occurrence will not significantly increase the probability of violation of a safety goal \(3.139\)

> Note 1 to entry: As shown in ISO 26262-5:2018, Annex B, both non-safety and safety-related elements \(3.144\) can have safe faults.
>
> Note 2 to entry: Single-point faults \(3.156\), residual faults \(3.125\) and dual-point faults \(3.39\) do not constitute safe faults.
>
> Note 3 to entry: Unless shown relevant in the safety \(3.132\) concept, multiple-point faults \(3.97\) with higher order than 2 can be considered as safe faults.
