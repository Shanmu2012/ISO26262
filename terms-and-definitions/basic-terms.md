# ASIL-related terms and definitions

## Architecture

representation of the structure of the item \(3.84\) or element \(3.41\) that allows identification of building blocks, their boundaries and interfaces, and includes the allocation of requirements to these building blocks 

项目（3.84）或元素（3.41）的结构的表示形式，它用于识别结构模块，以及边界和接口，并包括对这些结构模块的需求分配

## Automotive safety integrity level \(ASIL\)

one of four levels to specify the item's \(3.84\) or element's \(3.41\) necessary ISO 26262 requirements and safety measures \(3.141\) to apply for avoiding an unreasonable risk \(3.176\), with D representing the most stringent and A the least stringent level

四个等级中的每一个等级定义了 相关项 \(3.84\) 或要素 \(3.41\) 的必要的ISO 26262 要求和安全措施\(3.141\),用以避免不合理的风险\(3.176\), 其中 D 代表最高严格等级, A 代表最低严格等级

In 26262, ASIL is calculated based on :

* the severity of the injuries that could result from an event;
* the likelihood the event will occur in normal operation;
* and the number of drivers that could control the situation to avoid the injury.



## ASIL capability

capability of the item \(3.84\) or element \(3.41\) to meet assumed safety \(3.132\) requirements assigned with a given ASIL \(3.6\)

> Note 1 to entry: As a part of hardware safety requirements, achievement of the corresponding random hardware target values for fault metrics \(see ISO 26262-52018, Clauses 8 and 9\) allocated to the element \(3.41\) is included, if needed.

项目（3.84）或元素（3.41）能够满足给定ASIL（3.6）假定的安全（3.132）要求的能力

## ASIL decomposition

apportioning of redundant safety \(3.132\) requirements to elements \(3.41\), with sufficient independence \(3.78\), conducing to the same safety goal \(3.139\), with the objective of reducing the ASIL \(3.6\) of the redundant safety \(3.132\) requirements that are allocated to the corresponding elements \(3.41\)

> Note 1 to entry: ASIL decomposition is a basis for methods of ASIL \(3.6\) tailoring during the design process \(defined as requirements decomposition with respect to ASIL \(3.6\) tailoring in ISO 26262-9\).

> Note 2 to entry: ASIL decomposition does not apply to random hardware failure requirements per ISO 26262-9. Note 3 to entry: Reducing the ASIL \(3.6\) of the redundant safety \(3.132\) requirement

> Note 3 to entry: Reducing the ASIL \(3.6\) of the redundant safety \(3.132\) requirements has some exclusions, e.g. confirmation measures \(3.23\) remain at the level of the safety goal \(3.139\).

将冗余安全（3.132）要求以足够的独立性 （3.78）分配给元素（3.41\)，从而确保相同的安全目标（3.139），目的是减少分配给相应的元素（3.41）的冗余安全性（3.132）要求的ASIL（3.6）
