# Functional safety and SOTIF

## Definitions:

**Functional safety** is defined as:

absence of unreasonable risk \(3.176\) due to hazards \(3.75\) caused by malfunctioning behavior \(3.88\) of E/E systems.

**SOTIF -- Safety of the Intended Functionality** is defined as:

The absence of unreasonable risk due to hazards resulting from functional insufficiencies of the intended functionality or by reasonably foreseeable misuse by people.

## Comparisons

Functional safety is to prevent any crashes caused E/E systems. 

SOTIF is a safety process that addresses unintended system behavior in the absence of random hardware failures.
