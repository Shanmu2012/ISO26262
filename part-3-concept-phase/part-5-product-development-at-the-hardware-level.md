# Part 5: Product development at the hardware level

In part 5, we have:

## 8 Evaluation of the hardware architectural metrics \(FMEDA\)

## 9 Evaluation of safety goal violations due to random hardware failures \(FTA\)

### **Objective**

to provide evidence that the residual risk of a safety goal violation, due to random hardware failures of the item, is sufficiently low. NOTE: "sufficiently low" means "comparable" to residual risks on items already in use and known to be safe."
