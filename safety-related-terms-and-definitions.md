A safety case shall be developed in accordance with the safety plan in order to document for the achievement of functional safety.

The safety case should progressively compile the work products that are generated during the safety lifecycle to support the safety argument.

> NOTE 1 In the case of a distributed development, the safety case of the item can be a combination of the safety cases of the customer and of the suppliers, which references evidence from the work products generated by the respective parties. Then the overall argument of the item is supported by arguments from all parties. The interfaces between the customer and a supplier are defined in a Development Interface Agreement \(see ISO 26262-8:2018, Clause 5\).
>
> NOTE 2 To support safety planning, the intended safety arguments can be identified prior to work products becoming available. To support progressive functional safety assessments, the safety case can be released progressively as work products are generated to provide evidence for the safety arguments.
