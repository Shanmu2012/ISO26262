# Basic terms and definitions

## 3.1 Architecture

representation of the structure of the item \(3.84\) or element \(3.41\) that allows identification of building blocks, their boundaries and interfaces, and includes the allocation of requirements to these building blocks 

项目（3.84）或元素（3.41）的结构的表示形式，它用于识别结构模块，以及边界和接口，并包括对这些结构模块的需求分配

## 3.4 Assessment

examination of whether a characteristic of an item \(3.48\) or element \(3.41\) achieves the ISO 26262 objectives

## 3.5 Audit

Examination of an implemented process with regard to the process objectives

## 3. 7 Availability

capability of the item \(3.84\) or element \(3.41\) to meet assumed safety \(3.132\) requirements assigned with a given ASIL \(3.6\)

> Note 1 to entry: As a part of hardware safety requirements, achievement of the corresponding random hardware target values for fault metrics \(see ISO 26262-52018, Clauses 8 and 9\) allocated to the element \(3.41\) is included, if needed.

可用性

在在特定时间或给定的期间内,假设所需的外部资源是可用的,在给定条件下,产品处于执行所需功 \(2.69\)或 要 素 \(2.32\)的 版 本 。

## Confirmation measure

## Controllability



## Element

## Error

## Exposure

## External measure

## ASIL decomposition

apportioning of redundant safety \(3.132\) requirements to elements \(3.41\), with sufficient independence \(3.78\), conducing to the same safety goal \(3.139\), with the objective of reducing the ASIL \(3.6\) of the redundant safety \(3.132\) requirements that are allocated to the corresponding elements \(3.41\)

> Note 1 to entry: ASIL decomposition is a basis for methods of ASIL \(3.6\) tailoring during the design process \(defined as requirements decomposition with respect to ASIL \(3.6\) tailoring in ISO 26262-9\).

> Note 2 to entry: ASIL decomposition does not apply to random hardware failure requirements per ISO 26262-9. Note 3 to entry: Reducing the ASIL \(3.6\) of the redundant safety \(3.132\) requirement

> Note 3 to entry: Reducing the ASIL \(3.6\) of the redundant safety \(3.132\) requirements has some exclusions, e.g. confirmation measures \(3.23\) remain at the level of the safety goal \(3.139\).

将冗余安全（3.132）要求以足够的独立性 （3.78）分配给元素（3.41\)，从而确保相同的安全目标（3.139），目的是减少分配给相应的元素（3.41）的冗余安全性（3.132）要求的ASIL（3.6）
